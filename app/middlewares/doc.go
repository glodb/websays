// Package middlewares provides a collection of middleware components and interfaces
// essential for managing cross-cutting concerns and enhancing the behavior of API
// endpoints across the project.
//
// Middleware components in this package are designed to intercept, modify, or enhance
// HTTP requests and responses universally, ensuring consistency and common functionality
// across all API routes. For instance, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware
// is one such component responsible for handling cross-origin requests.
