// Package validators provides a collection of validators that implement the Validator interface.
// These validators are designed to validate incoming data based on the specific requirements of each API.
// Each validator defines a Validate method, which takes a URL as a parameter and performs data validation
// specific to that API. Validators play a crucial role in ensuring that data received by the API endpoints
// meets the expected criteria and is suitable for processing.
